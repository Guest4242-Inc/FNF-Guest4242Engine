# 🎤 Friday Night Funkin' Guest4242 Engine 🎶

Welcome to the **Friday Night Funkin' Guest4242 Engine**! The rhythm game you’ve all been waiting for (or maybe you were just looking for a fun distraction from your homework)! Built with love using HaxeFlixel for Ludum Dare 47... and maybe a little bit of procrastination.

## ⚠️ Warning: Proceed With Caution ⚠️

This engine is **in beta** and I’m **bad at Haxe coding**. Seriously, don’t expect perfection. The code is like spaghetti—good luck finding the meatballs.

But hey, it’s made with **love** for Newgrounds and the entire community. Extra love goes to **Tom Fulp** for being a total legend.
